// The CDK overlays depend on a small set of structural styles to work correctly. If you're using Angular Material,
// these styles have been included together with the theme, otherwise if you're using the CDK on its own, you'll
// have to include the styles yourself. You can do so by importing the prebuilt styles in your global stylesheet:
@use "node_modules/@angular/cdk/overlay-prebuilt";
@use "core";
@use "components";
