name: Build and publish package
#
# This workflow should run when a new release is published
#
# To publish the package we manually call the individual steps in the release.js script
# - npm run package:build
# - node scripts/copy-package-file.js
# - and finally npm publish distribution
#
# A standard `npm publish` would require a two-factor password. In place of a two-factor password we're using an automation
# token generated specifically for the nw-style-guide package. This is stored in `secrets.NPM_PUBLISH_TOKEN`
